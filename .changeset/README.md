# Changesets

This directory contains changesets for automated version management and changelog generation.

## How it works

Changesets are automatically created by GitHub Actions workflows based on:

- Branch naming conventions (feat/, fix/, break/)
- Commit message scopes
- PR titles following conventional commits

No manual changeset creation needed - it's all automated! 🚀
